##Useful files if you use tomcat:

* pick the jndi configuration for the database you want to use
* rename the file to geonetwork.xml (or to appName.xml if you use another name)
* put the file inside tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhost
* be sure that the jar for the driver you want to use is in tomcat/lib
